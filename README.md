## Project Overview

This Power BI project provides an in-depth analysis of the FIFA 22 player dataset. The primary goal is to uncover relationships between player age, overall performance, and other key attributes. The interactive dashboard allows for a dynamic exploration of player statistics, offering insights into the demographics and skill distribution across the world of professional football.

## Dashboard & Visualizations

The main dashboard provides a high-level view of the player data. The key visualizations include:

#### 1. Player Age Distribution
*   **Description**: This histogram shows the total count of players at each age.
*   **Insight**: The player population is heavily concentrated in the early to mid-20s, peaking around age 22. This distribution highlights the high turnover and early-peaking careers common in professional football.

#### 2. Average Overall Rating by Age
*   **Description**: This bar chart illustrates the average "Overall" skill rating for players at each age.
*   **Insight**: While younger players are more numerous, the average skill rating tends to peak for players in their late 20s and early 30s. This suggests that experience contributes significantly to a player's overall effectiveness, up to a certain point before retirement age.

*   **Prerequisites**: Microsoft Power BI Desktop installed on your machine.

## Data Source

The analysis is based on the official FIFA 22 player dataset, which contains detailed attributes for thousands of players.

*   **Dataset Name**: FIFA 22 Complete Player Dataset
*   **Source**: Kaggle (or specify other source)

## Tools and Technologies

*   **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Microsoft Power BI
*   **Data Cleaning (Optional)**:  Excel

## Future Work

Potential improvements and further analyses for this project include:
*   Analyzing the relationship between player wages (`wage_eur`) and performance (`overall`).
*   Creating a "Best Value" report to find underrated players with high potential but low market value.
*   Adding filters for specific leagues, clubs, or nationalities.
